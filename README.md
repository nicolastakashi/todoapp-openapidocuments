# Todo App - OpenAPI Documents


## Runing

If you want to lint and run a mock server, you must to install the dependencies before, as you can see below.

```
yarn // or
npm install
```

## Linting OpenAPI Documents

Check if your APIs are being designed following the proposed guidelines by your company, which could be a difficult job to do manually.
Thereby we can ask for a tool like Spectral to help us and create an autonomous process, to do this job.

Spectral is an open-source project that works like a linter to OpenAPI documents and has a lot of rules to ensure very common guidelines in the software industry to develop RESTFul APIs.

To run Spectral you can just run the command below. 

```
yarn lint
```
